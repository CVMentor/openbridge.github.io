       <h1>Openbridge Data Bridge Services</h1>
       <h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Data Bridges are considered “outbound” data services. They are adapters that are built for “fetching”  (connecting, processing and storing data) from a third party data source. Unlike Pipeline services, where data is sent directly to Openbridge services by upstream applications, Data Bridges create “outbound” connections to any systems that provides a method to extract data, either via API or other means. There are two types of Bridges:

<h2>Pre-Built Data Bridges</h2>
Pre-Built Data Bridges provide ready-made frameworks to easily connect to third party APIs. The pre-built bridges allow quick configuration, testing and deployment into the data warehouse. The following are the current pre-built data bridges;

<ul>
<li>Google Analytics Core Reporting API
<li>Google DoubleClick DFA
<li>Google DoubleClick Search
<li>ExactTarget Data Extension API
<li>Facebook Insights API
<li>Instagram API
<li>YouTube API
</ul>

<p>These perform GET functions or retrieving data from APIs. They are not meant for management or publishing data back to those services. 

<h2>Custom-Built Data Bridges</h2>
<p>Custom-Built Data Bridges are tailored applications that allow the delivery of proprietary, internal or third party data sources to the Openbridge system. Custom Data Bridges send data into Openbridge by wrapping application(s) around our Data Pipeline services. Your application can send data to the Streaming API or send files into the Stacks Service. Custom Data Bridges can be built by internal teams or Openbridge can build them on your behalf. 

<h2>Note</h2>
<p>There may be additional premiums companies charge to access their enterprise APIs. For example, while Twitter does not charge for its public API, it will charge for access to the “firehose” of tweets. There may be use cases where a customer requires access to the firehose over the more limited public API. These third party API costs are variable and not reflected in any Openbridge pricing.

<p>If employing tag management solutions like Tealium, Segment.io and Ensigten, this will enable hundreds of additional pre-built bridges. Tag management solutions provide the ability to use webhook like integrations that can send raw event data directly to the Openbridge Streaming API. Here are a list of integrations via Tealium (http://tealium.com/products/enterprise-tag-management/supported-tags/)

<p> Due to variations in customer implementations, security and legal requirements that govern third party data sources (i.e., Facebook, Twitter, etc.) typically require some level of configuration and/or customization.
