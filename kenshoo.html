       <h1>Setting Up Kenshoo Data Feeds</h1>
       <h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The following guide describes the process of Kenshoo sending paid search data to Openbridge. Exports from Kenshoo will require a special request to the Kenshoo support team to setup. 

<h3>Delivery Endpoints</h3>

<p>Kenshoo will send data via SFTP. 

<p>Delivery of files to the following
<ul>
<li>SFTP Hostname = <code>sftp.openbridge.io</code>
</ul>

<p>The following are the PORT numbers you will need to make sure are used by the system responsible for file delivery
<ul>
<li>SFTP = <code>port:2222</code>
</ul>

<h3>Delivery Directory and Filemasks</h3>

<p>Feeds must have specific directories on the Openbridge system that correspond to each reporting suite. For example, the Kenshoo delivery would be sent to the root of the report type directory like this: <code>".../(first 4 letters of comany name)_(report_type)/..." </code>
</p>
<p>The actual delivery will be zipped would follow this convention for the path and filemask.: <code>"/(report_type)/(report_type_YYYY-mm-dd).csv"</code>. This would result in a structure like this <code>"/kens_search/kenshoo_search_2015-12-15.csv"</code>.

<p> A report type might be "search" which reflects the paid search activity feeds. Your Kenshoo account rep will be able to details the currently available report type feeds avaiable from them

<h3>Access Credentials</h3>
<p>Kenshoo supports standard username and password credential for SFTP. Openbridge will supply these to you to supply to Kenshoo technical support team. 

<p>Kenshoo will only have access to the specific directory path mentioned previously. They are "locked" there and only have access to deliver files to the target directory.

<h3>Delivery Frequency</h3>
<p>Delivery frequency can be established with your Kenshoo account rep. We suggest daily delivery between 1AM and 6AM for the prior days data. 

<h3>Clickstream Feed Contents</h3>
<p>We have provided public repository of samples of clickstream data feeds on Github: <a href="https://github.com/openbridge/kenshoo">https://github.com/openbridge/kenshoo</a>
